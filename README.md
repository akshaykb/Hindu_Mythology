Hindu Mythology was the final project for the Creative Programming MOOC I participated in at Coursera. Find out more

Description

Hindu Mythology is a prayer service app built for Hindus. 

The app features 4 Hindu Gods and their related songs, particularly used as a form of prayer. Each tap on one of the 
pictures shown in the app starts the appropriate song.

The central ‘Swastik’ sign can be tapped to stop any of the currently playing tracks.

The app used Processing 2.0 as its core architecture for working. Apart from that it hosts custom images and 
interactions integrated in multiple views, for the application.

About Processing

Processing is an open source programming language and integrated development environment built for electronic arts and digital media. It is a java-based language built to teach computer programming in a visual context. Processing can be used to build highly audio/video interactive apps, creative digital media, electronic art etc. In Processing, all coded programs are known as sketches.

Compilation

The Processing integrated development environment (IDE) is required to compile the sketch. It can be 
downloaded from - http://www.processing.org/

Setup your IDE by downloading Android and Javascript modes, for running the app on Android/iOS devices. 
Download the modes from this link - http://www.blurrypaths.com/post/52573899794/processing-2-0-modes-
download-links

Put these modes under Documents\Processing\modes\ (Assuming a windows machine)

Create a new folder and name it "Hindu_Mythology" (This is necessary). Add all Hindu_Mythology repo contents into this folder. 
Simply click "Download Zip" from the panel on the right from this link - 
https://github.com/akshaykb/Hindu_Mythology

Once the IDE has been downloaded, open processing, goto file -> open. Now browse to the Hindu_Mythology folder and 
open Hindu_Mythology.pde. Click on the "run/play" button to execute the sketch.


A new window will pop up which will be the application window.

NOTE : Make sure the "data" folder, the "MaximJava_api.pde" and "GUI.pde" files are present in the same folder 
where Hindu_Mythology.pde file is present.Also make sure that "Java" mode is enabled on the top right panel 
present on the Processing IDE window. This will launch the app on the local computer.

FOR ANDROID DEVICES - Select "Android Mode" from the top right panel in the Processing IDE. Before that 
you might need to setup your android environment. You need to download the Android SDK.

The following links will help -

After complete setup, connect your phone to the computer, enable USB debugging under "Developer Settings"
menu and run the script.

FOR iOS DEVICES - Select "Javascript Mode" from the top right panel in the Processing IDE. Now click the run 
button, the app will be launched in the web browser. Make sure you are on the same wireless network on the 
computer and the mobile device.

Now,Open Safari on your mobile device. In the address bar type in the ip address of your computer followed by a 
colon and the port number that the web browser (running the processing sketch) on the computer will show. And hit 
enter.

In Safari , the address bar should have a link that looks something like this - " http://192.168.0.108:23454 " where 
23454 is the port number. To get the ip address on MAC use ifconfig on the terminal. On windows use ipconfig at 
command prompt.
